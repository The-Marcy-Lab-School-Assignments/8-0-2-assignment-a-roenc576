# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
When you make an API request from the frontend, the API key will be exposed to anyone using the application if they view the network requests. If you store your API key in the server instead and you make the frontend send a request to your server and the server send a request to the third-party, then the client won't be able to see it.
