# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
When you make an API request from the frontend, the API key will be exposed to anyone using the application if they use the network tab to view the requests being made. If you make an API request from the server, then the client won't be able to see it.
